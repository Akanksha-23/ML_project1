    "## Number of marks available for Part 1: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope: Sessions 1 to 5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Please READ the whole assignment first, before starting to work on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How and what to submit\n",
    "\n",
    "A. A **Jupyter Notebook** with the code in all the cells executed and outputs displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Name your Notebook **COM4509-6509_Assignment_Part1_Username_XXXXXX.ipynb** where XXXXXX is your username such as such as abc18de.  \n",
    "\n",
    "C. Upload a .zip file to Blackboard before the deadline that contains the Jupyter Notebook in B and any other files requested for the solution of Part 2 of the Assignment (Dr Lu will be in charge of releasing this part). \n",
    "\n",
    "D. **NO DATA UPLOAD**: Please do not upload the data files used in this Notebook. We have a copy already. \n",

    "### Assessment Criteria \n",
    "\n",
    "* Being able to use numpy and pandas to preprocess a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Being able to use numpy to build a machine learning pipeline for supervised learning. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Late submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow Department's guidelines about late submissions, i.e., a deduction of 5% of the mark each working day the work is late after the deadline. NO late submission will be marked one week after the deadline because we will release a solution by then. Please read [this link](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/comughandbook/general-information/assessment/late-submission) if you are taking COM4509 or read [this link](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/compgtstudenthandbook/menu/assessment/late-submission) if you are taking COM6509. \n",

    "### Use of unfair means \n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Any form of unfair means is treated as a serious academic offence and action may be taken under the Discipline Regulations.\"** (from the students Handbook). Please carefully read [this link](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/comughandbook/general-information/assessment/unfair-means) on what constitutes Unfair Means if not sure, for COM4509. If you are taking COM6509, please read [this link](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/compgtstudenthandbook/menu/referencing-unfair-means) if you are not sure what is Unfair means. If you still have questions, please ask your Personal tutor or the Lecturers. "
